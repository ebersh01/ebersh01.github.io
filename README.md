Through this homework assignment, I believe I implemented a number of HTML
attributes properly.  I was able to successfully create headers, paragrahs, and embed images into my various files by using the proper HTML tags.  I was able to upload all the files I used into my Github repository, as I was constantly adding files, commiting them with meaningful messages, and pushing them to my repository.  This made it possible for me to continually make changes and update my files as needed.
