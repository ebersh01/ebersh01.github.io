Through this homework assignment, I believe I implemented a number of HTML
attributes properly.  I was able to successfully create headers, paragrahs, and embed images into my various files by using the proper HTML tags.  I was able to upload all the files I used into my Github repository, as I was constantly adding files, commiting them with meaningful messages, and pushing them to my repository.  This made it possible for me to continually make changes and update my files as needed.  I was also able to create stylesheets in order to change the formatting of my various webpages.

I did not collaborate with anyone for the assignment, as I was able to complete it alone.

I spend approximately 4-5 hours on this assignment.  It took me a while to figure out how to use the Git commands and the proper syntax for HTML and CSS.  However, once I figured out these things, I was able to implement my website fairly efficiently.s
